<h1> Hello there; I'm Leonard, </h1>

I am a publisher turned full stack engineer with experience in implementing MVC Architecture patterns, designing RESTful APIs that support web applications, querying databases with SQL, and working in cloud computing environments such as AWS. My latest project involved deploying a flask application to Kubernetes using AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service(EKS). 

I'm currently working on a self-help application that can interpret numerological patterns, calculate life path numbers and teach users how to integrate numerology into their daily lives to manifest higher qualities. I am able to translate application requirements into new solutions through Python, C#, JavaScript/Typescript, SQL, React, etc. 

I have a Materials Engineering background from the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, and exposure to software engineering methodologies and best practices through comprehensive programs like Udacity's ALX-T FSND program, and several coding boot camps.

I love to tear code apart, experiment with it and improve it (in a separate GIT branch, yh:)).

I am committed to life-long learning and want to utilize my unbridled passion for coding to create a positive impact in the tech and finance industry and the world.

Fun Fact: ðŸ˜„
NASAâ€™s reusable space shuttle in the 1970s had less code than our phones today.
